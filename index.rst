.. warning::
    As humans write software, it can have bugs. You should follow established
    software development best-practices when writing your smart contracts, this
    includes code review, testing, audits, and correctness proofs. Smart contract
    users are sometimes more confident with code than their authors, and
    blockchains and smart contracts have their own unique issues to
    watch out for, so before working on production code, make sure you read the
    :ref:`security_considerations` section.

If you have any questions, you can try searching for answers or asking on the
`Ethereum Stackexchange <https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/>`_, or our `gitter channel <https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity/>`_.
