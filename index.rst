With 100000 TPSs, Bitconch is the fastest basic public chain in the world,
dedicated to building a truly decentralized network and infrastructure for it.
Based on the orginal POR reputation consensus algorithm, Bitconch develops 
Bit-R reputation quantification anti-centralization node governance system
and Blaze zero delay ledger access technology, which effectively solves the 
incompatibility of "high speed, security and decentralization".

.. warning::
    As humans write software, it can have bugs. You should follow established
    software development best-practices when writing your smart contracts, this
    includes code review, testing, audits, and correctness proofs. Smart contract
    users are sometimes more confident with code than their authors, and
    blockchains and smart contracts have their own unique issues to
    watch out for, so before working on production code, make sure you read the
    :ref:`security_considerations` section.

If you have any questions, you can try searching for answers or asking on the
